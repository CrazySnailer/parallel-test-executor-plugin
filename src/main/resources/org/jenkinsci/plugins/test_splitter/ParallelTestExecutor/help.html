    Given another job that runs tests, executes muliiple runs of it concurrently by interleaving tests,
    achieving the parallel test execution semantics.

    <p>
    This builder can be used with any test job that (1) produce JUnit-compatible XML files, and
    (2) accept a test-exclusion list in a file. This builder looks at the test execution time from
    the last time, and divide tests into multiple units. Each unit is then converted into the
    exclusion list (by excluding all but the tests that assigned to that unit), and the test job
    is triggered with this exclusion file placed inside the workspace at your specified location.

    <p>
    You are responsible for configuring the build script in the test job to honor the exclusion file.
    A standard technique is to write the build script to always refer to a fixed exclusion list file,
    and check in an empty file by that name. You can then specify that file as the "exclusion file name"
    in the configuration of this builder, and the builder will overwrite the empty file from SCM
    by the generated one.

    <p>
    At the end of the executions of the test job, the specified report directories are brought back into
    this job's workspace, then the standard JUnit test report collector will tally them.
